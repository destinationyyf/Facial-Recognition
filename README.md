# Facial-Recognition

This project is based on the paper of Viola-Jones, using Haar-like features to quantify pictures, decision tree algorithm to create weak classifiers and adaptive boosting method to build the final strong classifier.

It has 6 files in total:

* `faces.zip` and `background.zip` are training sets; `class.jpg` is the testing picture;
* `Facial Recognition.py` is the main code including all functions and codes that execute the project;
* `Documentation.pdf` is generated from `Documentation.rmd`, it explains in detail the theoritical part of the project, how the codes and functions work, and the final recognition result of the testing picture.
